---
Iâ€™m a freelance ghostwriter specializing in writing online content for the internet. I write landing page copy, blog posts, e-newsletters and e-books with all rights reserved to the employer who hires me. I research and carefully tend to the details, providing engaging, relevant content designed to generate online traffic and influence purchasing decisions. My expertise includes adhering to branding guidelines and optimizing copy for search engines (SEO). I have a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations, and a decade of experience working with startup companies in health and wellness industries. I enjoy serving as an extension of busy, ambitious teams and look forward to partnering with those in need of my creative ghostwriting services.
