### Freelance Online Content Writer Available For Hire

I'm an online content writer for health and wellness industries. I write website copy, blog posts, e-newsletters and e-books. My background includes a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations and a decade of digital marketing experience. Pursing an interest in natural living and holistic healing has led me to writing content about naturopathic medicine and a range of environmental issues. I enjoy fully immersing myself into each new project and look forward to upcoming opportunities to collaborate with businesses making a healthy impact on the world.
