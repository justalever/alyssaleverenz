### Online Content Writer Available For Hire

I’m a freelance marketer specializing in writing online content for tech companies. My job is to connect prospective customers with the solutions that my clients offer, while also promoting customer retention, by providing engaging, helpful information to prospects on the internet. I do this by carefully implementing written content that influences purchasing decisions. My expertise involves researching a wealth of complex, esoteric knowledge and distilling it into concise, easy-to-understand bits. This knack has enabled me to write about complicated topics in emerging technology, like blockchain in cryptocurrency and nanotechnology in healthcare. My creative process includes collaborating with executive teams, adhering to branding guidelines, ensuring proper search engine optimization (SEO) and, of course, monitoring results. The content I create is designed to generate online traffic and convert website visitors into loyal customers. My background includes a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations and a decade of digital marketing experience. Aside from writing about technology, I'm also a family woman and mother of [2 toddlers](https://www.instagram.com/lexandruby/), who are my absolute pride and joy. Any chance I can write about parenting, child development or early childhood education, I will take it. Real estate investing is my latest venture, and I currently have a [short-term rental property](http://marconirental.com/) that I manage, so I like to write about that as well. Natural living and holistic health are my passions, and I have experience writing for agriculture and renewable energy industries. I enjoy fully immersing myself into each new project and look forward to upcoming writing opportunities. Past work samples and client testimonials are available upon request.
