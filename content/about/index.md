Iâ€™m a ghostwriter specializing in writing online content for the internet. Businesses hire me to write landing page copy, blog posts, e-newsletters and e-books with all rights reserved. I carefully tend to the details, using engaging, relevant written content designed to help influence purchasing decisions. My expertise also includes adhering to branding guidelines and optimizing copy for search engines (SEO). I have a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations, and nearly a decade of freelance writing experience. I enjoy serving as an extension of busy, ambitious teams and look forward to partnering with those in need of my creative ghostwriting services.
