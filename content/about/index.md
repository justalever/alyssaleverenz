Iâ€™m a freelance ghostwriter specializing in writing internet content for startup companies in health and wellness industries. I write landing page copy, blog posts, e-newsletters and e-books with all rights reserved to the employer who hires me. I research and carefully tend to the details, providing engaging, relevant content for online readers. My expertise includes adhering to branding guidelines and optimizing copy for search engines. I have a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations, and a decade of professional experience. I enjoy serving as an extension of busy, ambitious teams and look forward to partnering with those in need of my creative services.
