---
I’m a ghostwriter specializing in writing online content for the internet. Written works I create belong 100% to the employer who hires me– all rights reserved. Businesses from various industries hire me to write landing page copy, blog posts, e-newsletters and e-books. My expertise is writing engaging, relevant content optimized for search engines to generate online traffic and convert visitors into customers. My job is to use words to help influence purchasing decisions. I research and craft communications using valuable information to inform and inspire online readers. I have a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations, and nearly a decade of ghostwriting experience. I love serving as an integral extension to marketing teams and partnering with those in need of my creative services.
