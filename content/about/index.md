### Ghostwriter Available For Hire

Approaching a blank page can be daunting even to the most invincible of creatives. Plus, the process of writing a long-form masterpiece is known to be convoluted and may become frustrating for non-professional writers. With infinite ways to express our minds, it is quite a daring task to share our story with the world. There are endless ways for our unique message to be interpreted, so finding the right words to convey profound meaning in a way that resonates with the intended audience is a complex challenge.

Oftentimes, those who lead the most amazing lives packed with awe-inspiring insights, who hold a wealth of knowledge and wisdom that would benefit others– are busy focusing on the things that make them a genius. They may not have the availability or bandwidth to properly articulate it all. 

That's where I come in– I’m a ghostwriter, and there is no assignment that I can't adapt to. 

My duty is to empower those who have something important to say. I bring the power to create literature, and my purpose is to partner with those who have a chronicle to tell. Through a series of extensive interviews, I gather a thorough outline including organized talking points, overall takeaways, the tone of voice to strive for and other unique criteria to keep in mind while crafting written works. Our experience together is a collaboration to successfully usher ideas to fruition for readers to relish in a timeless, handheld manner.

### A bit about me

My background includes a Master of Arts degree in Strategic Communication, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Public Relations and over a decade of freelance writing experience. I’ve ghostwritten e-books, technical manuals and online content, mostly for tech companies, and I also have experience ghostwriting speeches up to 20 minutes in length and scriptwriting for video ads. Most recently, I've experimented with novels, memoirs and nonfiction books. I consider myself a prolific writer with versatile writing abilities. Each writing project is a new challenge that I enjoy fully immersing myself into, and I look forward to upcoming writing opportunities. My name is irrelevant because all credit and rights are reserved to the client who hires me, but it's Alyssa, for those wondering.

Aside from writing my heart out, I'm also a family woman and mother of [2 toddlers](https://www.instagram.com/lexandruby/), who are my absolute pride and joy. Real estate investing is one of my latest ventures, and I currently have a [short-term rental property](http://marconirental.com/) that I manage. I like art, music, literature, emerging tech, gardening, cooking, traveling and holistic health. Past work samples and client testimonials are available upon request.
